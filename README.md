# S4 (Super Simple Scheduling System)

This is a REST API to manage Students and Classes. The project has been implemented using the following frameworks/libraries:

* Spring Boot.
* Spring Data REST.
* Spring Data JPA.
* H2 Database Engine. (In memory database)

I have chosen those technologies because they already provide you the whole infrastructure to implement a Standard CRUD restful API. Here are some pros that would be good to mention for each of them:
* Spring Boot: Follows the microservice architecture. Could be easily deployed in several platforms including Docker and be scaled as needed.
* Spring Data REST: Provides you already the REST API CRUD functionality implemented for any entity you want to expose. Good to mention that it has integrated HATEOAS for the API navigation.
* Spring Data JPA: To take advantage of JPA boundaries for the data access layer.
* H2 Database Engine: Iâ€™ve chosen this just for the exercise storing needs since is just an in memory database.

## Prerequisites

Is needed to have installed:

* Java 1.8
* Apache Maven 3.2.1 or newer.

## Packaging

Run the following command to build and package the tool.

```
mvn clean package
```

## Running

Run the following command to start the server.
```
java -jar target/s4-0.1.0.jar
```

## Usage
All the endpoints provides HATEOAS navigation.

### Students
It provides CRUD functionality for its management. The main entry point is:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/v1/students
```

### Classes
It provides CRUD functionality for its management. The main entry point is:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/v1/classes
```

### Subscriptions
This feature enables a student to subscribe into several clasess. Here is an example of the endpoint usage:
Request:
```
POST http://localhost:8080/v1/students/1/classes
```
Payload:
```
{
	"code": 1
}
```
Response:

        }
    }
}
```

### Searches

```
GET http://localhost:8080/v1/students/search
